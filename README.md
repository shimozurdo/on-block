# On Block game

This was the very first game I made time ago, I used construct 2 an interesting engine for making fast games prototypes, very intuitive but with many technical limitations.

I am not sure, but I think Construct 3 is very similar or the same that construct 2, so I decided to share this project. Have fun!
